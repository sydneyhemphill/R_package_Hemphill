Description: This package is meant to be a starter package for R, allowing shortcuts and easily accessible processes like: clean up (removing NAs), plotting (simple ggplots (scatter plots)), and statistical tests (summary of a linear model of data). Hopefully, the package will make simple processes easier to do, allowing less room for mistakes in beginner R users.
